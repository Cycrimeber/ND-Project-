# ND-Project-
This repository contains the files for my National Diploma Project work. 
This project work is unique as it was solely researched and the systems involved developed by me.
The uniqueness of the project comes about as its combines two platforms to create a seamless integrated software. Using MS Access linked to a web db, I was able to create a Personnel Information System using my current Unit (23 Brigade Garrison) as a case study.
